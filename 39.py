Integer right triangles

If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides,
{a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.
{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?

Approach: if a+b+c=p and a**2 + b**2 = c**2, then we can determine that:
2*(c*p + a*b) = p**2 => a*b = p*(p/2 - c). Using another factorization,
b = (p**2 - 2*p*a)/(2*p-2*a). We can thus conclude that:

* p is an even integer
* p divides the area of the triangle a*b
* a<b and a<c and without loss of generality a<=b => a < p/3
